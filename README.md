Core Java Revision and Practice Repository

This repository contains my Core Java practice and revision exercises, completed after a learning gap to strengthen my fundamentals again.  
I decided to revisit all major Core Java topics to refresh my concepts and coding confidence.

After a short break, I restarted my Java journey to revise:
- Java syntax, OOPs concepts, and control structures  
- Exception handling and file I/O  
- Collections Framework and Generics  
- Multithreading and synchronization  
- Java 8 features like Lambda expressions and Streams  
- Basic problem-solving and mini coding exercises
